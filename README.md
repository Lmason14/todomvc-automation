# todomvc-automation

Repo contains:
- Tests for the ToDo react framework in Firefox browser
- Tests for the ToDo react framework in Chrome browser
- Page Object Model for test suite

What we would do next:

- Further refactoring of the code in the tests
- Further development of POM so that locators can be abstracted from the tests themselves 
- Utilise implicit waits to ensure elements have time to load and located correctly 
- Tags to allow filtering of tests
